- When network capacity is lower than smallest video rate, we of course will continuously encounter rebuffer events
  because we cannot download one second of lowest rate video per second.
- If the buffer is smaller than the maximum video rate, we can get "stuck". If the excess bytes in the buffer are
  great enough, it can cause the algorithm to choose a video rate greater than our buffer size. This leads to a rebuffer of course. To avoid this, we could simply ensure the algorithm doesn't pick a (video rate * chunk sec) greater than our buffer size.
  - Note that this does not happen when the buffer is equal to any (video rate * chunk seconds). If it is, then every
    time period we simply fully fill and fully empty the buffer.
- If the buffer size is less than the lowest video rate, we will obviously never download a single chunk of video.
- It is possible for the algorithm to rebuffer if both the capacity is low and the cushion are small. The small cushion
  means the max video rate will be quickly chosen, locking us into a video rate for quite some time (due to the small
  capacity), leading to a rebuffer when we run out of downloaded chunks.
- Had to modify given algorithm to only ever pick "safe" rates, as defined in paper. Prior to this, lots of unnecesssary
  rebuffers. After, none!
